Last week Wednesday, when I was enjoying my time after a long-day work, doing the Docker set up while listening to the music; all of a sudden, PuTTY console froze after I entered the "hello world" docker command. "ah, it's okay, I've met similar issue before, just restart the EC2 instance and it will be back to normal", I was thinking naively.
